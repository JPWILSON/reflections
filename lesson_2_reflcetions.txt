What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	This is the process of opening a git file, from where you can use the 
	"commit" command in order to commit the file(s) that you have been working
	on. You can now also make use of the "checkout" commmand, to revert to, 
	or simply inspect an older commit. 
	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A hidden git file is created which will start to store metadata about the 
	history of the repository, since its creation. You need to do this in order 
	to be able to commit changes to your code. If you do not do this, there would 
	not be a way to track the changes to the various files. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it adds?
	The staging area is a temporary section working with various documents, ie the specific
	ones that you would like to make a commit for. The working directory, and the repository,
	once they have been made, are both permanent. 
	It is valuable in that it allows for the upload of whichever files you select, otherwise
	 you would have to commit all files, which would not be congruent with the 
	 philosophy of commiting at our own logical points. That is, some of the files may not be
	 being worked on, and so shouldn't have a commit at that point.
