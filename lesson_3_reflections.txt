When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are worried about backing up/ working on someone else's/ public library's computer. 
	Or when you are collaborating and therefore many people in remote locations need access to the
	repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 

	You would do this for the same reason as you commit manually; you may never have a 
	version of working code, you may not know the right time to pull changes, etc.
