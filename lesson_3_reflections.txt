When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are worried about backing up/ working on someone else's/ public library's computer. 
	Or when you are collaborating and therefore many people in remote locations need access to the
	repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 

	You would do this for the same reason as you commit manually; you may never have a 
	version of working code, you may not know the right time to pull changes, etc. 

Describe the difference between clones, forks and branches? When would you use one instead of the other? 
	
	Forks are clones made by GitHub on GitHub. They are made so that you can make changes to a certain
	repository even if the owner of the original work does not give you permission to change their original. 
	Clone is when you copy a repository for yourself to work on, either from the internet in general, GITHub in 
	particular, or your own computer. Branches are made when you want to change some of your code, without affecting the 
	original direction of the master path of code.
